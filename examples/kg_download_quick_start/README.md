# Using Deep Search Knowledge Graphs with PyTorch Geometric - Quick start

Deep Search can construct Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by parsing large collections of documents.
This tutorial shows how to download these knowledge graphs and import them locally in PyTorch Geometric, a popular graph neural network library.
