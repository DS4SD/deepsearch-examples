      "[0030] The compositions and methods of the invention pro› vide useful silicon nitride removal rates over a wide range of pH, abrasive concentration, and surfactant concentration, while unexpectedly suppressing polysilicon removal. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the silicon nitride removal rate is about 250 Angstroms per minute (A/min) or greater when polishing a silicon nitride blanket wafer with a Epicfi Dl00 polishing pad (Cabot Microelectronics Corpo› ration, Aurora, Ill.) on as table-top CMP polisher at a down force of about 2 pounds per square inch (psi), a platen speed of about 115 revolutions per minute (rpm), a carrier speed of about 60 rpm, and a polishing slurry flow rate of about 125 milliliters per minute (mL/min), in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (about 1 wt %). Surprisingly, the polysilicon removal rate obtained by polishing a polysilicon wafer under the same conditions generally is not more than about 80% of the silicon nitride removal rate, often not more than about 70% or not more than about 60% of the silicon nitride removal rate. Typically, the polysilicon removal rate obtained with a CMP composition of the present invention will be at least about 10% lower (preferably at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% lower) than the polysilicon rate obtained with a CMP composition substantially identical to the composition of the invention, but lacking the alkyne dial or alkyne dial ethoxy› late surfactant.\n"
