# Data query - Highlighted snippets

When running search queries on large collections, you may be interested in retrieving only
certain details of the query matches, instead of downloading the full documents in the result set.
For instance, you may want to retrieve snippets from some fields where the matches occur or
you may be interested in just aggregated values from the matched documents. In this example,
we show several search capabilities supported by Deep Search to the make some data anaytics
use cases more efficient.
