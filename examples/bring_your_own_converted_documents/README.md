# Bring Your Own Converted Documents

In some use cases you will be ingesting documents which have previously been converted or parsed. For example,
you might have generated your documents directly in JSON format, or you might have converted the documents
with Deep Search, exported, modified and next you would like to re-ingest them.

In this example we demonstrate how a folder with converted JSON documents can be uploaded to a data collection
in Deep Search.
