       "\n",
       "## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
       "\n",
       "[0002] Compositions and methods for chemical-mechani› cal polishing of the surface of a substrate are well known in the art. Polishing compositions (also known as polishing slur› ries, CMP slurries, and CMP compositions) for CMP of sur› faces of semiconductor substrates (e.g., integrated circuits) typically contain an abrasive, various additive compounds, and the like.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0003] In general, CMP involves the concurrent chemical and mechanical abrasion of surface, e.g., abrasion of an over› lying first layer to expose the surface of a non-planar second layer on which the first layer is formed. One such process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,648 to Beyer et al. Briefly, Beyer et al., discloses a CMP process using a polishing pad and a slurry to remove a first layer at a faster rate than a second layer until the surface of the overlying first layer of material becomes coplanar with the upper surface of the covered sec› ond layer. More detailed explanations of chemical mechani› cal polishing are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,85 No. 4,910, 155 and No. 4,944,836.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0004] In conventional CMP techniques, a substrate carrier or polishing head is mounted on a carrier assembly and posi› tioned in contact with a polishing pad in a CMP apparatus. The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to the substrate, urging the substrate against the polishing pad. The pad and carrier, with its attached substrate, are moved relative to one another. The relative movement of the pad and sub› strate serves to abrade the surface of the substrate to remove a portion of the material from the substrate surface, thereby polishing the substrate. The polishing of the substrate surface typically is further aided by the chemical activity of the pol› ishing composition (e.g., by oxidizing agents, acids, bases, or other additives present in the CMP composition) and/or the mechanical activity of an abrasive suspended in the polishing composition. Typical abrasive materials include silicon diox› ide, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and tin oxide.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0005] U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,423 to Neville, et al., for example, describes a method for chemically-mechanically polishing a metal layer by contacting the surface of the metal layer with a polishing slurry comprising high purity fine metal oxide particles suspended in an aqueous medium. Alternatively, the abrasive material may be incorporated into the polishing pad. U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,233 to Cook et al. discloses the use of polishing pads having a surface texture or pattern, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,794 to Bruxvoort et al. dis› closes a fixed abrasive polishing pad.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0006] A semiconductor wafer typically includes a sub› strate, such as silicon or gallium arsenide, on which a plurality of transistors has been formed. Transistors are chemically and physically connected to the substrate by patterning regions in the substrate and layers on the substrate. The transistors and\n",
       "\n",
       "layers are separated by interlevel dielectrics (ILDs), com› prised primarily of some form of silicon oxide (SiO 2). The transistors are interconnected through the use of well-known multilevel interconnects. Typical multilevel interconnects are comprised of stacked thin-films consisting of one or more of the following materials: titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum (Ta), aluminum-copper (Al--Cu), aluminum-sili› con (Al-Si), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), doped polysilicon (poly-Si), and various combinations thereof. In addition, tran› sistors or groups of transistors are isolated from one another, often through the use of trenches filled with an insulating material such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and/or poly› silicon.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0007] The traditional technique for forming interconnects has been improved by the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,648 to Chow et al., which relates to a method for producing coplanar multilevel metal/insulator films on a sub› strate. This technique, which has gained wide interest and produces multilevel interconnects, uses chemical mechanical polishing to planarize the surface of the metal layers or thin› films during the various stages of device fabrication.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0008] Although many of the known CMP slurry composi› tions are suitable for limited purposes, the conventional tend to exhibit unacceptable polishing rates and corresponding selectivity levels to insulator materials used in wafer manu› facture. In addition, known polishing slurries tend to produce poor film removal traits for the underlying films or produce deleterious film-corrosion, which leads to poor manufactur› ing yields.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0009] Co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/374, 238 to Chen et al. describes novel polishing compositions having a pH of about 1 to about 6 including an abrasive in combination with certain acidic components (e.g., combina› tions ofmalonic acid and an aminocarboxylic acid; stannate salts; uric acid; phenylacetic acid; or combinations of mal› onic acid, an aminocarboxylic acid, and sulfate) to polish silicon nitride substrates.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0010] Co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/448, 205 to Dysard et al. describes novel polishing compositions having an acidic pH and including at least one additive having a pKa in the range of about 1 to 4.5 to polish silicon nitride substrates.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0011] As the technology for integrated circuit devices advances, traditional materials are being used in new and different ways to achieve the level of performance needed for advanced integrated circuits. In particular, silicon nitride, silicon oxide, and polysilicon are being used in various com› binations to achieved new and ever more complex device configurations. In general, the structural complexity and per› formance characteristics vary across different applications. In some cases, conditions suitable for effective removal of one component of a substrate, such as silicon nitride, can unde› sirably lead to over-removal of another component, such as polysilicon.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0012] Accordingly, there is a continuing need for CMP compositions and methods to achieve acceptable removal rates of silicon nitride, silicon oxide or tungsten for many IC device applications, while suppressing polysilicon removal. The present invention provides such improved polishing methods and compositions. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.\n",
       "\n",
       "## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
       "\n",
       "[0013] The present invention provides CMP compositions useful for selectively polishing a semiconductor substrate to remove a component such as a silicon nitride, silicon oxide or tungsten from the surface of the substrate while suppressing polysilicon removal. A CMP composition of the invention comprises abrasive particles suspended in an acidic aqueous carrier containing a surfactant comprising an alkyne dial and/or an alkyne dial ethoxylate (preferably an alkyne dial). In a preferred embodiment, a CMP composition of the inven› tion comprises about 0.01 to about 15 percent by weight abrasive particles suspended in an acidic aqueous carrier con› taining about 10 to about 10,000 ppm of the surfactant. In some preferred embodiments, the abrasive particles comprise colloidal silica. Preferably, the acidic aqueous carrier has a pH value of not more than about 6 (e.g., about 1 to about 4, or about 2 to about 3). The surfactant preferably is present in an amount in the range of about 20 to about 1,000 ppm. If desired, the compositions of the invention can include other additive materials such as a carboxylic acid material (e.g., malonic acid and/or glycine) and/or an organic or inorganic salt (e.g., potassium sulfate). For example, the composition can comprise about 10 to about 100,000 ppm (0.001 to about 10 percent by weight) of at least one carboxylic acid material. The CMP compositions can also include other common addi› tive materials utilized in CMP compositions, such as bio› cides, viscosity modifiers, corrosion inhibitors, chelating agents, organic polymers, other surfactants, oxidizing agents, electron transfer agents, and the like, many examples of which are well known in the CMP art.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0014] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for polishing a substrate to remove a component such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide or tungsten in preference to polysilicon. The method comprises abrading a surface of the substrate with a CMP composition of the present invention, preferably in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The abrad› ing can be accomplished, for example, by contacting a surface of the substrate with a polishing pad and the CMP composi› tion, and causing relative motion between the polishing pad and the substrate while maintaining a portion of the CMP composition in contact with the surface between the pad and the substrate for a time period sufficient to abrade silicon nitride from the surface.\n",
       "\n",
       "[0015] The CMP compositions of the present invention provide effective removal rates of silicon nitride, silicon oxide or tungsten while unexpectedly suppressing polysili› con removal in comparison to the results obtained with sub› stantially the same formulation in the absence of the alkyne dial or alkyne dial ethoxylate surfactant.\n",

In some preferred embodiments R $^{1 }$and R $^{2 }$are both methyl. Preferably, at least one ofR $^{3 }$and R 4 is a branched aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety (e.g., 2-methylpropyl). As used herein, the term 'ethoxylate ' refers to a compound of Formula (I) in which one or both of the OH groups of Formula (I) is replaced by a (CH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$O) n----CH$_{2}$H$_{2}$OH group in which 'n ' is 0 or greater, and the total number of moles ofEO per mole of dial compound is the sum of (n+ 1) for each ethoxylate chain in the compound.

Surprisingly, the polysilicon removal rate obtained by polishing a polysilicon wafer under the same conditions generally is not more than about 80% of the silicon nitride removal rate, often not more than about 70% or not more than about 60% of the silicon nitride removal rate. Typically, the polysilicon removal rate obtained with a CMP composition of the present invention will be at least about 10% lower (preferably at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% lower) than the polysilicon rate obtained with a CMP composition substantially identical to the composition of the invention, but lacking the alkyne dial or alkyne dial ethoxy› late surfactant.\n",

       "surfactant, acids, bases, buffers, oxidizing agents, and the like), as well as any combination ofingredients. For example, the abrasive can be dispersed in water, and the surfactant and any other additive material can be added, and mixed by any method that is capable of incorporating the components into the polishing composition. Typically, an oxidizing agent, when utilized, is not added to the polishing composition until the composition is ready for use in a CMP process, for example, the oxidizing agent can be added just prior to ini› tiation of polishing. The pH can be further adjusted at any suitable time by addition of an acid or base, as needed.\n",
