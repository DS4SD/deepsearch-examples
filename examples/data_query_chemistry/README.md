# Data query - Chemistry

Chemistry is one of the focal domains for Deep Search. One of the key resources is exposing a search across
chemistry databases like PubChem, etc and the possibility to link data with the document collections.
In this example we start with example searches for molecules both by name, synonyms or SMILES.
