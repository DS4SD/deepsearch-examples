# Document QA

Deep Search allows users to interact with the documents using conversational AI, i.e. the user interacts with a virtual assistant which answers their questions using the information from a document collection or a specific document.

:point_right: For getting started, check out [QA Quick Start](./qa_quick_start.ipynb).

### Access required

The content of this notebook requires access to Deep Search capabilities which are not
available on the public access system.

[Contact us](https://ds4sd.github.io/) if you are interested in exploring
the enterprise-level Deep Search capabilities.


### GenAI Integration required

When interacting with the virtual assistant, Deep Search requires a connection to a Generative AI API. Currently, we support connections to [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) or the IBM-internal GenAI platform BAM.

Deep Search allows custom GenAI configurations for each project.
In the above notebooks you will need to work in a project which has such GenAI capabilities activated.
