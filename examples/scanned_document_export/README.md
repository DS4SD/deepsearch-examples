# Bring Your Own PDFs

In this example we expand upon [Bringing Your Own PDF](../bring_your_own_pdf) with more functionality.
We will create a new data index to which we will upload scanned pdf documents that will be OCRed, this will
allow you to explore their contents with the full capabilities of Deep Search.
