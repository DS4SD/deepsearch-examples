# Data query - Chemistry and PatCID

PatCID is a collection of molecular structures to speed up discovery of new molecules, automatically and at scale with Deep Search.
This large-scale collection was created by processing molecular images in United States, European, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese patents.
In this 
We have applied a graph-based visual recognition model to obtain high-precision conversion of these molecular images (MolGrapher, ICCV2023, accepted). Contact us for early access.

In this example we will demonstrate how to interact with Deep Search for
- Querying molecules by similarity or substructure
- Given a list of patents, show the molecules that are mentioned
- Given a list of molecules, list the patents mentioning them
