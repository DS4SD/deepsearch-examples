# Export to JSON

In this example we demonstrate how you can export the index items of a given project data
index to JSON. To illustrate this, we first create a demo project and project data index.
Using these resources, we then upload some documents for Deep Search to convert. The
resulting Deep Search index items are now easily exported to JSON.

:point_right: Run the [json_export.ipynb](./json_export.ipynb) notebook.
