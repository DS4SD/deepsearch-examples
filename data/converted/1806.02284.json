Consequently, there is a great need for systems that can ingest these documents at scale and make the contained knowledge discoverable. Unfortunately, both the format of these documents (e.g. the PDF format or bitmap images) as well as the presentation of the data (e.g. complex tables) make the extraction of qualitative and quantitive data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present a modular, cloud-based platform to ingest documents at scale. This platform, called the Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), implements a pipeline which allows users to parse and annotate documents (i.e. collect ground-truth), train machine-learning classification algorithms and ultimately convert any type of PDF or bitmap-documents to a structured content representation format. We will show that each of the modules is scalable due to an asynchronous microservice architecture and can therefore handle massive amounts of documents. Furthermore, we will show that our capability to gather ground-truth is accelerated by machine-learning algorithms by at least one order of magnitude. This allows us to both gather large amounts of ground-truth in very little time and obtain very good precision/recall metrics in the range of 99% with regard to content conversion to structured output. The CCS platform is currently deployed on IBM internal infrastructure and serving more than 250 active users for knowledge-engineering project engagements.",

These documents range from manuals for appliances, annual reports of companies, all the way to research papers, detailing a specific scientific discovery. It is needless to say that valuable qualitative and quantitative information is contained in many of them. However, content encoded in PDF is by its nature reduced to streams of printing instructions purposed to faithfully present a pleasing visual layout. Both the data representation and the enormous variability of layouts across these documents make it extremely challenging to access content and transform it into a representation that enables knowledge discovery. In addition to the sheer current quantity of documents, the submission rate of published documents in the scientific domain is also growing exponentially$^{2}$. This poses a real problem, since more and more information published in the PDF documents is going dark. In order to make the content of these documents searchable (e.g. find me a phase-diagram of material XYZ), one needs essentially two components. First, you need to ingest documents from a variety of formats (with the PDF format being the most prevalent one) and convert these documents to structured data files with a structured format such as JSON or XML. Second, you need a query engine that is able to deal with a large variety of concepts (documents, images, authors, tables, etc) extracted from these documents and put these into context.",

This platform, called Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), consists out of a set of microservices organized in five main components. Each of these microservices can be consumed by its own REST API. This approach not only allows us to build complex pipelines to process documents automatically, but also allows us to develop new microservices against the platform. In order to make this platform scalable, all microservices are integrated through asynchronous communication protocols, which gives us many benefits: It allows to do proper resource management, eliminates strong dependencies and makes the platform robust against single task failures.",

Broadly speaking, there are two types of approaches to this problem. In the first approach, documents are converted with the goal to represent the content as close as possible to the original visual layout of the document. This can be done through a conversion from PDF towards HTML or MS Word for example. The second approach attempts to convert the document into a format that can be easily processed programmatically, i.e. a representation of the document which is not preserving the layout, yet contains all the content from the original document in a structured format. For example, this could be a JSON/XML file with a particular schema. Since our Corpus Conversion Service is thought of as a first step towards a knowledge discovery platform for documents, we have opted for the second approach in our solution.",

This is the first big distinction between the current existing solutions and ours: Existing solutions take one document at a time (no matter its origin) and convert it to a desired output format.

Hence, not only do we need the ability to manage collections of documents, we also need the ability for people to annotate documents and store these annotations in an efficient way. These annotations are then used as ground-truth data to train models. It is clear then that ML models add an extra level of complexity: One has to provide the ability to store a collection of documents, annotate these documents, store the annotations, train a model and ultimately apply this model on unseen documents. For the authors of this paper, it was therefore evident that our solution cannot be a monolithic application. It fits much better the concept of a cloud-based platform that can execute the previously mentioned tasks in an efficient and scalable way.",

This lack of a precise definition has its origins not only in the ISO-standard 8 detailing the PDF document code but also in the variability of the quality of PDFs. Older PDFs which were created from scanned images using OCR typically return cells for each word, while more recent PDFs allow us to create cells for full text-lines. This variability in the geometric features of the cell (e.g. the width of the cell) can negatively impact the performance of later machine learning models. As a consequence, we reduce the variability of the geometric features as much as possible. The more consistent and homogeneous the geometric features of a cell are, the better the machine learning algorithms can do predictions.",

We then ask the (human) annotator to assign each cell a layout semantic label. Examples of semantic labels are: Title, Abstract, Authors, Subtitle, Text, Table, Figure, List, etc$^{10}$. In the annotator tool, each layout semantic label is visually represented by a colour. By assigning a colour to each semantic label, the task of semantic annotation is translated into a colouring-task, as can be seen in Figure 3. Since humans are very efficient in visual recognition, this task comes very natural to us. The required time spent to annotate a single page starting from the parsing output has shown to average at 30 seconds over various annotation campaigns.",

Clearly, the result of a prediction for each page can therefore be displayed as if it were an annotated page. This allows the users to directly inspect the results of the models on unseen pages. A direct consequence of this inspection capability in the annotators is that the annotation task can be transformed easily into a correction task, i.e. the human annotators only need to correct the incorrectly predicted labels. Of course, as the models become better over time, the number of corrections needed to be made become less and less. This allows us to significantly reduce the annotation time per document. Since annotations are typically created by professionals with a high hourly rate, the colouring technique allowed us to significantly reduce the cost of ground-truth gathering.",

Examples of such objects are tables, figures with their captions, mathematical formulas, etc. Due to the high variability in both the document layout as well as in the representation of these objects, we need very robust object detection methods. Currently, the most robust methods for detecting objects are deep neural networks such as R-CNNs (and their derivatives Fast-and Faster-R-CNN) [5, 6, 10], the YOLO architecture [8, 9] and the SSD networks [7]. On our platform, we have the Faster-R-CNN [10] and the YOLOv2 [9] networks available as individual microservices, both for training and predictions.",

In the training phase, we ensure that both algorithms ran each 100 epochs, i.e. all 25000 page images were fed to the network 100 times. We observe that the out-ofthe-box Faster R-CNN from Tensorflow does not implement any batching during the training phase, while YOLOv2 batches 8 images at a time, thanks to an image resizing which is automatically applied. We believe that this is the main origin for the discrepancy of time-to-solution for the training phase. The same holds true for the prediction. Therefore, from the point of view of the platform, the YOLOv2 architecture seems better suited for deployment, as it allows to have a much higher throughput (‚âà 10 pages/sec/node).",

In other words, we want a service that can ingest millions of documents, serve potentially thousands of users and scale its compute resources such that the time-to-solution is reasonable at all times for any operation. It is clear that the architecture of such a service is heavily influenced by these requirements.",

We show this scaling by displaying the speedup versus the number of worker nodes available. Here, we chose to have four workers serving each pipeline microservice, since each worker is running on a node with four cores. As one can observe, the speedup in the parse and ML apply tasks scales linearly with the the number of workers, and thus the nodes. Notably, we can even observe a slightly better-than-linear speedup, which appears due to bandwidth constraints on the baseline with one worker. The speedup on the assemble tasks, in comparison, flattens off sooner, as this task can only be parallelised on the document and not on the page level. The variability in the length of documents is reflected in a load imbalance between the worker nodes, however this averages out with sufficiently large corpus sizes. Consequently, we are able to scale the compute resources in order to keep the time-to-solution constant for any job-size.",

We strongly believe that the results can be greatly improved since the neural networks we currently use are optimised for photographic images, and not images of parsed document pages (as is shown in Figure 5). To leverage this growing use of deep learning models, we will additionally introduce",
