Converting documents into a machine-processable format is a particular challenge here due to their huge variability in formats and complex structure. Accordingly, many algorithms and machine-learning methods emerged to solve particular tasks such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), layout analysis, table-structure recovery, figure understanding, etc. We observe the adoption of such methods in document understanding solutions offered by all major cloud providers. Yet, publications outlining how such services are designed and optimized to scale in the cloud are scarce. In this paper, we focus on the case of document conversion to illustrate the particular challenges of scaling a complex data processing pipeline with a strong reliance on machine-learning methods on cloud infrastructure. Our key objective is to achieve high scalability and responsiveness for different workload profiles in a well-defined resource budget. We outline the requirements, design, and implementation choices of our document conversion service and reflect on the challenges we faced. Evidence for the scaling behavior and resource efficiency is provided for two alternative workload distribution strategies and deployment configurations. Our best-performing method achieves sustained throughput of over one million PDF pages per hour on 3072 CPU cores across 192 nodes.",

On the computational side, this relies on multiple algorithms and machine-learning (ML) models specialized for particular tasks. Examples for such models include OCR [7], document layout analysis [8]-[10], table structure recovery [11], [12], figure understanding [13], reference and citation resolution [14], etc. Furthermore, the ML landscape is evolving rapidly, with new models frequently exposing significantly different characteristics in terms of computational expenses, memory usage, or accelerator re-",

For instance, a single output file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) needs to be produced for each PDF file that is submitted. Contrary to other data formats such as images or plain text, documents have an internal granularity in the shape of pages. This trait can be exploited, since many operations can be executed independently on each page. Examples of such operations are text-cell identification (either through parsing programmatic PDF code or through OCR), layout segmentation, table-structure recovery, figure classification, etc. Two critical constraints need to be recognized here. Firstly, the intra-page operations may have dependencies. For instance, table-structure recovery relies on text-cell identification and on layout segmentation to locate a table. Secondly, the results of each operation on each page needs to be ultimately merged into a single output document (see Figure 1, phase D). This merge operation ensures that the content of the document has the correct section-structure and ordering. It is therefore an invalid assumption that the conversion of a document can be simply treated as an embarrassingly parallel",

While this provides opportunity for highly concurrent execution, it can create significant imbalance in the number and runtime of operations for a given page, due to their extremely varying complexity. Adding to this, the PDF format has inherent properties that make it very opaque. Therefore, there is no practical way to estimate the complexity and resource demand required for processing ahead of execution time. From an architecture perspective, the above is suggesting an approach which decomposes the full chain of operations and data into tasks. Such tasks can then be created and executed concurrently through an orchestration mechanism that is aware of their dependencies.

To date, they outcompete any rule-based algorithm in document conversion tasks and even approach human-like accuracy in particular tasks such as layout analysis [16]. From a systems perspective, ML models bring an own set of challenges. First, solving the conversion task requires many different types of ML models as outlined earlier. Each of these models has different runtime characteristics and resource requirements in terms of CPU cores, memory demand, and accelerators. Furthermore, ML models evolve at a rapid pace. Consequently, to quickly adopt state-of-the-art ML models in production, our cloud service needs to be flexible with regard to integration of new models. Encapsulation of ML models into separate microservices, each serving on an own endpoint, can provide for both resource isolation and easy integration. We will discuss choices for ML serving and scaling in Section III.",

From a user experience perspective, there are strong requirements to be met regarding the conversion speed and the response time. Our goal is to provide a cloud service which supports both bulk-conversion of huge document repositories, as well as ad-hoc conversion of individual documents. In the former case, a key concern is to achieve the highest (sustained) document throughput and ensure it scales proportionally to the compute resources. Importantly, this should allow to set a time-budget for a large conversion workload, e.g., a full online library, and infer the compute resource cost, or conversely, estimate the conversion time with a given resource budget. In the latter case, the primary objective is to achieve the shortest time-tosolution (TTS), allowing for an interactive user experience. Here it is important to note that the smaller a workload is (e.g., one document), the more challenging it becomes to achieve proper workload balancing in a distributed processing scheme. Both goals are reflecting in the scaling behavior of the system, which we will examine in Section IV-E. Additionally, we want to enable multi-tenant operation for many users on one application instance. Therefore, the service must provide",

Here, the user-facing API only accepts a document conversion request and enqueues a corresponding task on a message broker. Clients receive an immediate response with the task's identifier, which can be used to retrieve the conversion result once the processing is completed. The worker processes attach to a task queue, consume tasks competitively, and write status information and task output to a (transient) results-backend and a persistent database (see Figure 2). Since large conversion workloads can be partitioned horizontally, workers are not required to communicate to each other or share resources. Hence, worker processes can be run isolated in containers and trivially replicated both inside and across cluster nodes through kubernetes. Tasks produced in a conversion job can reside on the task queue or on a worker process and eventually persist their state on the results-backend. Together, this ensures that a task remains traceable over its whole lifetime. As such, a queue-worker architecture protects the system from compute congestion through request overload, promises reliability, and enables simple scaling, at the cost of potentially delayed processing. However, queue mechanisms may also add I/O overhead and latency to the system, even in idle state. Consequently, TTS in ad-hoc conversion may be handicapped. To minimize such adverse effects, we chose to use online workers, which boot at service deployment time.",

Instead of executing ML inference codes inside the workers, we externalize ML models as microservices with a simple REST API. The slightly less efficient interface and added I/O compared to direct codebinding and shared memory inside a worker process has proven to be a reasonable sacrifice to the significantly lower integration effort for new models. Ease of integration is a key requirement in the fast-evolving ML model landscape. Additionally, model serving can be resource-budgeted and scaled out independently from workers. The latter is particularly relevant for resource efficiency since our ML inference is computationally far more expensive and at the same time far less dynamic in memory use than other operations (e.g., PDF splitting, parsing, and merging). Leveraging this benefit would otherwise demand several different worker types and queues (one for each model), therefore increasing the complexity in the core system. In our service implementation, we wrap ML model codes in a python aiohttp webserver runtime and rely on knative serving for scaling and load-balancing [21]. This compares well to the technology used in popular ML serving frameworks such as ray.io $^{7}$, Seldon Core $^{8}$, or TensorFlow Serving $^{9}$.",

Examples for the latter are retrieving a PDF file over the network, unpacking an archive, exporting to a target database, or storing and fetching intermediate task results. A feasible approach we found is to interleave I/O-bound and computebound operations on the same worker, while allowing only one compute-bound operation to execute at the same time.

To our surprise, none of the available options could meet our needs, since distribution and execution of asynchronous co-routines as tasks is widely unsupported. Few attempts to provide this capability have remained experimental and are poorly maintained or abandoned [22], [23]. Therefore, we decided to implement a custom library to orchestrate asynchronous tasks, which we make available as open source under the name Mognet $^{14}$. Fundamentally, it allows to create worker processes that initialize an asyncio event loop and attach to an amqp 15 message broker and a redis 16 instance for storage of every task's status. A worker process subscribes to a queue and fetches up to X tasks at once, which are then executed on the worker's event loop concurrently. To support the dynamic nature of our pipeline, we explicitly allow any task to produce (many) subtasks and await their completion. Subtasks are submitted to the task queue, like any task. Since all tasks are asynchronous co-routines, waiting for subtasks is a nonblocking and cheap operation. It is worth mentioning that waiting for subtasks creates a risk for deadlocks. A task may wait for subtasks forever while they cannot be scheduled on any worker, because all workers are occupied up to their limit X. To circumvent this situation, the local limit X of concurrently scheduling tasks on a worker is incremented by 1 each time a task produces any number of subtasks, and decremented by 1 again when the producing task completes.",

Instead of producing and enqueueing every possible subtask at once, the producing task may instead iteratively enqueue new subtasks only as previous subtasks finish. This allows precise control over how many subtasks are submitted from a producer task at once and therefore enables to keep the task queue short. A concrete example for this case is the root task of a conversion job, which produces one subtask for each document. Given a number of N workers, enqueueing much more than N tasks at once is to no benefit for distributed processing. Conversely, it can delay the scheduling of competing conversion jobs. Enqueueing the N +1 st document subtask only when the first document subtask finishes instead gives opportunity for better interleaving of tasks belonging to competing conversion jobs on the queue. The same principle translates to the level of pages inside one document. We demonstrate the effect of this strategy in section IV-F.",

The timeto-solution (TTS) for a particular conversion job is defined as the time difference between the submission of the first batch of documents and the retrieval of the last converted document. The throughput is defined as the number of processed pages per unit of time. Notice that the number of processed documents per unit of time is not a good metric as documents have a variable number of pages. The effective throughput is computed by determining the number of processed pages from the input dataset and dividing it by the TTS. The sustained throughput is defined as the number of processed pages from the input dataset divided by the time in which all compute resources are busy processing (from t$_{0}$ until t$_{w}$, see Fig. 3). Importantly, the effective throughput will be dependent on the data volume of the conversion job, while the sustained throughput is independent of the data volume of the conversion job. In the limit of a very large conversion job, the effective throughput will asymptotically reach the sustained throughput, as the time proportion of partially idle worker state at the end of a job will be negligible compared to the time in saturated worker state. Additionally, we observe the serial time of the benchmark conversion job. It is defined as the sum of all task runtimes in each conversion job and, in the ideal case, it is constant unless a resource bottleneck is present.",

First of all, we find that the TTS at the lowest scale (12 nodes) is very similar across both deployment profiles and task distribution schemes. As we scale up the number of cluster nodes, we first recognize that both distribution schemes achieve reasonable speedup in TTS. However, the TTS in the document-level distribution scheme beats the TTS in page-level distribution scheme by a growing margin at increasing scales. This observation also mirrors in the effective throughput. At the largest scale (192 nodes), the achieved speedup in TTS starts to tail off to different degrees in both schemes, irrespective of the deployment profile. Our test dataset converts within 17 minutes in the best case (document-level scheme, profile B) and 25 min in the worst case (page-level scheme, profile A). Contrary to our theoretical considerations, the loss in scaling efficiency affects the pagelevel scheme much stronger than the document-level scheme. Deeper investigation revealed that two different causes are responsible for the observed loss in scaling efficiency. In the document-level distribution scheme, long documents increasingly dominate the TTS of the full conversion job, some of which take over 14 minutes to convert alone (see Fig 6). Thus, TTS would be lower-bounded at 14 minutes even with infinite resources.",

This bottleneck is completely absent in the document-level distribution scheme since it's implementation creates no database transactions at all. Further, interleaving tasks on the same worker (profile B) does not demonstrate significant benefit to TTS or effective throughput over the non-interleaving setup (profile A) in either of the distribution schemes. A different picture shows when looking at the sustained throughput. In the document-level distribution scheme, we are observing even slightly better-than-linear scaling, which is clearly distinct from the effective throughput.",

The first is owed to small imperfections in the load-balancing of requests to our ML model replicas. The fewer ML model replicas exist, the more pronounced is the impact of an unbalanced distribution of requests to those. Relatively speaking, a larger fraction of requests will be subject to additional waittimes for the response. The second factor is a peculiarity of our worker implementation. To regularly clean up the excess memory allocated (but not used) in the python runtime, worker pods reboot after every 64 completed (document-level) tasks. This causes a delay of approximately 10 seconds each time. In each conversion job, such reboots occur more frequently when fewer workers need to consume more tasks. Therefore, we",

Concurrent conversion workloads of very different volume are processed in a reasonably fair manner, all while avoiding the complexity of job priorities or separate queues. Still, the TTS on a busy system is significantly higher in the page-level distribution scheme, since the single-document conversion job produces a total of 12 tasks, which pass through the task queue, compared to only one in the document-level distribution scheme.",

Disregarding all non-parallelizable operations (upload, merge, and export), the theoretical speedup would be bounded at 4x for 15 pages, because we chose to configure our system to create tasks for batches of up to four pages. Dynamically deciding the optimum page-batch size based on the page count could improve this aspect. In reality, we must consider two factors: On one hand, profiling the page-level distribution scheme reveals that approximately one quarter of the total conversion job run-time is spent in the non-parallelizable operations for this document. On the other hand, the pagelevel distribution pays a high price on additional I/O, as shown earlier. In the observed case, it requires 12 distinct store and retrieve operations, while the document-level scheme requires only two. As such, TTS in ad-hoc conversion can profit from the page-level distribution scheme only with longer documents.",

Additionally, it allows to write idiomatic code. It should be noted however that the efficiency advantage of interleaving tasks as proposed here depends significantly both on the amount of opportunity to avoid blocking I/O and on the proportion of compute-bound code executing in the workers. Externalizing the ML models as web-services has proven to be a sensible choice in this regard. Considering the large fraction of total compute-time spent in ML inference, investing effort into cheaper ML models will remain a top priority in our ongoing work.",
