## Structure of the repository

We are structure the examples into themes folders, which helps navigating
the content and finding what good starting cookbooks for your needs.

Each folder is an independent example which includes dependencies to
the `deepsearch-toolkit` package, as well as other modules needed for the
showcase demonstrated (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `rdkit`, etc).
Please refer to the individual `requirements.txt` in each folder for
a complete set of dependencies.
